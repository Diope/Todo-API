# Todo Notes API

This is a API created for a simplistic Todo app (such a novel app to be sure. I was more focused on making sure I understand things less so on creating something breathtaking). Utilizing nothing more than Postman, Visual Studio Code, and the command line.

You can play around with it [here](https://intense-mountain-46848.herokuapp.com), you're going to need postman to get around as there is no front end. Feel free to do whatever with it.
